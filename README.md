# Trello Clone
This repo was created for me to practice building a larger React application. I wanted to make something that was scalable, so if you notice anything that seems off, please let me know! ðŸš€

## Installed Packages
1. [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - I wanted to try out using styled components as a library, since it seems like this is what larger scale projects are opting for with React.
