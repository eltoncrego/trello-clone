# Trello Clone
This repo was created for me to practice building a larger React application. I've based it heavily on some pretty popular repositories.

First off, I'd like to credit the architecture and organization to [Ivor Reic](https://github.com/oldboyxx)! His [Jira Clone Project](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone) is honestly inspiring to say the least and I strive to create projects that are as neat as that repo.

Secondly, I'd like to credit the overall design and feel of the project to [The Team Behind This Behance Post](https://www.behance.net/gallery/47031411/Trello-Atlassian-Redesign). Their case study of the current Trello product, color palette, and font choices inspired me to work towards developing their mockups.

## Packages
1. [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - I've used this primarily so that I can get props into my CSS code. Styled components also utilizes SASS syntax which is nice for bundling styling and components into one neat little package.
2. [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - I've used this for routing throughout the app. It's a pretty great framework for managing navigation and routing.
3. [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - This is Atlassians' official package for beautiful drag and drop elements.
