# Project Structure üèó

For the server, I wanted to keep things simple. I'm primarily a front-end developer, so this api was meant for me to just mock things while I build out the front-end app.

I'm using `nodemon` to keep the server auto-refreshing as I make code changes. All of the routing for the api is handled by `express`.

Also, I'm storing passwords as strings **in a real production app, don't do this it's a big no no for data security**. For now, I've done it this way because I don't plan on launching this. If I do, I'll update it to use a real authentication system.

| `src/index.js`  | The entry file. This is where we init the server running on the port specified. |
| `src/`  | Pretty much everything else is divided into it's individual file for it's function. |
